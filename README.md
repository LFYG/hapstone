# Hapstone - Haskell bindings for Capstone
This repository contains bindings to the Capstone disassembly framework
([link](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone)). At the time of writing,
both low-level and idiomatic bindings are present.

The documentation is probably pretty complete, but might need
clarification. In case you find bugs, want to contribute, especially
enhance the docs, please do this over issues/pull requests on GitHub,
contribution is always welcome.

Note that you need `c2hs` to compile.
